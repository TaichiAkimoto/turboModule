# Where to find TypeScript description

- Write description files in `RN-TSCodegen` instead.
- Delete file content here, instead re-export them from `RN-TSCodegen`

## Does not exist in react-native/index.js

- [x] `\react-native\Libraries\Utilities\codegenNativeComponent.js`
- [x] `\react-native\Libraries\Utilities\codegenNativeCommands.js`

This could be exported from RN-TSCodegen-Type by `require('react-native/Libraries/Utilities/codegenNativeComponent')`

## Does not exist in @types/react-native

- [x] `\react-native\Libraries\Types\CodegenTypes.js`
- [x] `\react-native\Libraries\Types\CoreEventTypes.js`
- [x] `\react-native\Libraries\TurboModule\RCTExport.js`
- [x] `\react-native\Libraries\TurboModule\TurboModuleRegistry.js`
- [x] `\react-native\Libraries\StyleSheet\StyleSheetTypes.js`: `ColorValue`, `ColorArrayValue`, `PointValue`
- [x] `Ref<T>`: in @types/react
- [x] `ElementRef<T>`: does not exist in @types/react
  - https://flow.org/en/docs/react/types/#reactelementreftypeof-component-
  - For now just rename ElementRef to Ref

## Somehow in @types/react-native

- [x] `\react-native\Libraries\Image\ImageSource.js`: there is `ImageURISource`, but no `ImageSource`
- [x] `\react-native\Libraries\Components\View\ViewPropTypes.js`: `ViewProps` used in test cases
